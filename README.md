I created an experience where a user is presented with 3 artifacts. These artifacts are small items from a specific period; ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and ancient Japan. Inspired by my interest in the game God of War. This experience allows a user to travel to a simulated environemnt once one of the items is picked up. A desktop user can user WASD to control the ccamera to move around, by closing the distance between an item, music begins to increase in volume. Once a user clicks with their mouse on the item.  The item is held by the user and they are transported to a different environemnt. They can then see a much larger statue from the specific time period. A user can return to the original spawn by returning the item to the podium. This design was used as it seemed to be a very simple yet intuitive way to transport the user, a level of shock factor with the instant teloportation was also something that I wanted the user to experience. On mobile devices a user can hold down on the screen to move forward. THe user can then look down at the floor and hold to move backwards. They can also just tap on the screen to interact with the items.

The most challenging was defenitly the pick up and drop item. I spent a day working on it, as it had some more complexities than just  picking it up. Initially I had it so that their were  three different pick up and three different drop item methods. But I felt that I could acheive a much more modular system. I had to do a lot of research through documentation especially with the  environemnt.

That is when I took advantage of the creating the properties of environment and the statues within the item that is being pciked up. By doing so I could simply the javascript exponentially. I was really happy with how the code worked out. It became a lot more modular allowing each item to specify the details of how the scene changed.
